## Project Description 

Surf makes it easy & safe to transfer tokens and collect NFTs on the Multi-chain wallet.
Surf Wallet is a platform that allows for convenient and secure transfer of tokens and collection of NFTs on the blockchain. The Surf DAO team is composed of five early supporters who are active in the blockchain community and committed to creating the best wallet experience.

Surf Wallet is not just another cryptocurrency wallet. The team is dedicated to making the blockchain ecosystem more accessible and is developing a mobile version of the wallet to break down barriers to entry. Their goal is to create the most accessible and secure wallet possible, enabling anyone to thrive in the world of blockchain.
