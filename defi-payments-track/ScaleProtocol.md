### Project Description
Scale Protocol is positioned to provide users with clear and transparent dealmaking derivatives trading. The team developed a new DPF (Dealer Price Feeds) trading model, realizing a more concise and smooth trading process with high leverage and low fees. Combined with the intelligent algorithm model, Scale maximizes the utilization rate of the capital and provides traders with better trading depth. At the same time, the protocol aggregates multiple assets, including but not limited to cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, precious metals, commodities, etc., to help traders achieve various asset hedging, and reduce trading risks. The team is committed to continuous innovation and iteration of the on-chain derivatives trading, providing a better trading experience, attracting more traders to join the Web3 world, and enjoying fair and smooth decentralized financial services.

Team members graduated from the University of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Finance, Information Technology, and MBA. They have nearly ten years of experience in global asset management, internet marketing and operating, and centralized exchange development and design. The consultant group has professional risk management skills in financial assets. The team has worked together for years on Web2 projects and cooperated with tacit understanding.
