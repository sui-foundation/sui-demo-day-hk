## Project Description 

MiniMars is a brand on Sui and by the Community. We’ll have 3388 MiniMars launched as the first generation to start the Mars program and also it’s a tribute to NASA. MiniMars cafe plan has been started. Now we have the first MiniMars cafe and there will be more since we have crowdfunding rights for holders. Also we’ll launch the next generation with other projects and brands.
