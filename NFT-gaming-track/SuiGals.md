## Project Description 

Sui-Native Virtual Idols NFT

Introducing "SUIGALS," a groundbreaking ###Virtual Idol NFT### series, set to become the Metaverse Ambassadors of the Sui network. 

As the era of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) dawns, virtual humans will undergo a transformative shift. Previously, virtual idols were simply human creations with perfect appearances, lacking self-awareness and independent thinking. 
However, with the rapid evolution of AI, virtual idols will soon possess the ability to create content autonomously, including writing songs, composing music, generating music videos, and hosting live concerts. 


SUIGALS will embark on their metaverse careers, releasing music videos, live streaming, and performing concerts. 
SUIGALS will also appear in various capacities across social media, gaming, and other metaverse projects.

Owning a SUIGALS NFT is akin to investing in a metaverse talent management company, allowing users to participate, invest, and co-develop the virtual idols' ownership. 
NFT Holders will enjoy voting rights, casting their vision in a DAO-voting for creative and career development decisions, sharing in the revenue generated by NFTs and intellectual property, and experiencing the operation of a top-tier entertainment company like SM Entertainment in the web3 world.
